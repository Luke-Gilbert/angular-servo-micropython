# angular-servo-micropython
Set servo to set angles when using microcontrollers with micropython

The best way to use is to download the servo_angles.py and put it on the Raspberry Pi Pico's (Or any other MicroPython Microcontroller) File System (I would recommend opening it in Thonny and then saving it to the file system.)
Then import servo_angles in your code.

I strongly recommend you see the examples in the example folder.

There is also a document detailing the available features for use.
